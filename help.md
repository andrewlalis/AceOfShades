# Ace of Shades - Help Information
In this document, we'll go over how to use the launcher, basic game controls, and some explanations of game mechanics so that you can start playing right away.

## Launcher
The launcher is a small application that makes it easy to connect to different servers to join their hosted games. The first thing you'll see is a list of servers. **You can remove or edit a server by right-clicking on it**, and **you can add new servers using the Add Server button** at the bottom.

Each entry in the list is just a way to remember a specific address (and optionally your preferred username when connecting to that server), so that **you can double-click on a server to instantly connect**.

> Servers have an *address* which consists usually of an IP address and port number. For example, there might be a server whose address is `123.123.123.123:54321`.
> 
> It's up to the server to decide whether to allow you to join, so pick a sensible username.

## Controls
To control your player in-game, the following are the default controls:

| Control      | Description                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `WASD`       | Move player forward, left, backward, and right. |
| `R`          | Reload your weapon.                             |
| `T`          | Start typing a message in chat.                 |
| `/`          | Start typing a command in chat.                 |
| `LEFT-CLICK` | Use your weapon.                                |
| `SCROLL`     | Zoom in or out.                                 |
| `MOUSE-MOVE` | Aim your weapon.                                |
| `ENTER`      | Send your message or command in chat.           |

> Be careful when typing a message or command in chat! Other players can and will try to kill you.

## Basic Mechanics
In most scenarios, when you join a server, you'll be placed onto a *team*. Each team has a spawn point, which is where you'll start out. There's also a resupply area for each team, where you can replenish your health and ammunition when running low.

Each time you kill someone from another team, your own team's score increases. Different servers may come up with different rules for what constitutes a victory, but the premise is simple: **kill as many enemies as possible**.

You can quit at any time by closing the game window.

> Some servers may have policies which discourage *combat-logging* (disconnecting when about to die), and they may ban you from reconnecting! Take this into account, and play fair.
